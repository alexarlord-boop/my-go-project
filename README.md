# Microservices with Go

## Overview
I'm following official [Go Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/) and a [YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmD8u-IFdreyh6EUfevBcbiuCKzFk0EW_&si=jM48arwPfZ4S1nfe) to complete Go labs and learn more about Go development.
This project is exploring how to build Microservices using the Go programming language.
